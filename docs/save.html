		<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

		All participants in the conference will be asked to
		abide by the following code of conduct at the time of
		registration. Organizers will enforce the code
		throughout the event.  We are expecting cooperation
		from all participants to help ensuring a safe
		environment for everyone.

		<p></p>		

		<h4>The Quick Version</h4>

		R@IISA dedicated to providing a harassment-free
		conference experience for everyone, regardless of
		gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical
		appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion
		(or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of
		participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery
		is not appropriate for any conference venue, including
		talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online
		media. Participants violating these rules may be
		sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a
		refund at the discretion of the organizers.

		<p></p>
		
		<h4>The Less Quick Version</h4>

		Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related
		to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
		orientation, disability, physical appearance, body
		size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in
		public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking,
		following, harassing photography or recording,
		sustained disruption of talks or other events,
		inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
		attention.

		<p></p>

		Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are
		expected to comply immediately.

		<p></p>

		Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment
		policy. In particular, sponsors should not use
		sexualised images, activities, or other
		material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should
		not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
		otherwise create a sexualised environment.

		<p></p>
		
		If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the
		organisers may take any action they deem appropriate,
		including warning the offender or expulsion from the
		conference with no refund.

		<p></p>

		If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is
		being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
		contact a member of staff immediately.  Staff will
		assist those experiencing harassment and put
		participants in touch with local enforcement
		authorities.
